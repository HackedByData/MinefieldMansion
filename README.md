# MinefieldMansion
A game to be played in the terminal that is similar to mines, but the user must collect gold and return to the original position to win.
As the user traverses throughout the field, they can utilize the keys (L)eft, (R)ight, (U)p, (D)own to move. There are several signs indicating
nearby monuments. If an S appears, the user is within a 1x1 radius, excluding diagonals, of the evil Aldrac. If a B appears, the user is nearby to
a bottomless pit. Both of these things will cause the player to lose the game if they enter the block. Once the user is in the same block as the gold,
they must pick it up and return to the original square to emerge victorious!
